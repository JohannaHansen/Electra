    <h3 style="color: #F34444">Sprint Goal 1</h3>

    <h4 style="color:black;">Our first sprint goal is to create a room where you are able to move around in first-person and see objects</h4>

    <h3 style="color: #F34444">Sprint Goal 2</h3>

    <h4 style="color:black;">  Room 1 should be done except for the lightning which will be added later, we should have laid the groundwork for room 2 in terms of creating walls and adding some furnitures, and started implementing 1 or 2 puzzles for room 2. We should have a drawing of how all four rooms are connected and how the puzzles connect to the specific rooms.</h4>

    <h3 style="color: #F34444">Sprint Goal 3</h3>

    <h4 style="color:black;">We should have a Beta version of the game that is playable. The player should be able to solve puzzles in room 1 and 2</h4>
